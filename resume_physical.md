## Experience

### **AI/ML Engineer | Full-Stack Developer**
**Integrum Global (TPC Group)** | Singapore | 2024 - Present

- Built **agentic LLM platforms** using LangGraph (4-node workflow: Planner → Thinking → Executor → Formatter) for investment & treasury operations, integrating multi-source APIs (PitchBook, CapIQ, Trading Economics, News) to generate real-time insights.

- Designed **multi-layer RAG pipeline** (BM25 + pgvector embeddings) improving document retrieval accuracy by 40% and enabling analysts to compare entities ("Horizon vs Horizon Oil") with structured reasoning.

- Architected **full-stack React/TypeScript dashboards** using ApexCharts, Recharts, Nivo, and Plotly for **Bloomberg-based market tracking**, geographic heat maps, and ESG form automation — supporting deal sourcing workflows and market intelligence reporting.

- Created **scalable OCR + document intelligence module** using OpenAI Vision for table parsing, form extraction, and semantic search across PDF, Excel, PowerPoint files.

- Developed **monthly macro & market insight generation pipeline**, unifying LLM reasoning with economic indicators and news signals to produce automated analyst-grade reports.

- Implemented **26-processor deal sourcing platform** connecting to Affinity CRM, PitchBook, CapIQ, and SharePoint APIs with Celery-based scheduling and Redis caching.

- Deployed production infrastructure via **Docker Compose** with Celery workers, Nginx reverse proxy, and TLS-secured endpoints.
